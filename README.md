# ProjLib Beta

ProjLib Beta is a themed, browser‑like web interface that lets you quickly launch and view curated sites in a sandboxed iframe — complete with dropdown menus, tab masking, a live news ticker, and playful animated themes.

## 🚀 Features

- **Customizable Home Page**  
  Loads a default home (`archive.org` by default — configurable in `hubData.json`).

- **Category Dropdowns**  
  Six categories (Brain Tease, Arcade, Animation, Readable, Watchable, Dailies) populated from `hubData.json`.

- **Tab Masking**  
  Change the tab’s title and favicon on the fly from a predefined list.

- **Theming Engine**  
  8 distinct animated visual themes:
  `dark`, `geek`, `minimal`, `kuromi`, `tech`, `comic`, `anime`, `cyberpunk`.

- **RSS News Ticker**  
  Scrolls the latest headlines (currently from RTP Mundo RSS feed).

- **Interactive Controls**  
  Home, Refresh, Theme Toggle, Fullscreen, and URL search form.

- **Notifications & Loading Overlay**  
  User alerts and loading spinner while iframe content loads.

- **Responsive Design**  
  Mobile‑friendly layout and controls.
